General Questions

What is the FaceLogger app?
FaceLogger is a mobile app that uses facial recognition to generate and store facial embeddings for secure authorization in club activities and facility access.

Who can use FaceLogger?
Only registered club members can use FaceLogger. You must create a facial profile during registration.

How does FaceLogger work?
The app captures multiple angles of your face, generates unique facial embeddings, and stores them securely for future identity verification.

Facial Embeddings:

What are facial embeddings?
Facial embeddings are mathematical representations of your facial features, created from multiple face angles, used for secure identification.

How are embeddings generated?
FaceLogger takes photos of your face from different angles, processes them with machine learning (e.g., CNNs), and creates a unique embedding.

Where are my embeddings stored?
Embeddings are stored in a secure, encrypted database, accessible only by authorized club systems.

Authorization and Access:

What if FaceLogger doesn’t recognize my face?
Retry the scan or use an alternative verification method (e.g., PIN or manual check-in). Contact a club admin if issues persist.

Privacy and Security:

Is my facial data secure?
Yes, embeddings are encrypted and stored securely, compliant with privacy laws like GDPR. No actual face images are saved.

Will my data be shared or sold?
No, your embeddings are used only for club authorization and are never shared or sold.

What happens if I leave the club?
Your embeddings can be deleted upon request. Contact the club administrator to initiate data removal.
